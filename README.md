# Heart_Disease_Kaggle
Data Science and Machine Learning Classifications
## Overview
First of all i will make some basics vizualizations to figure out in depth my data.
Then, will try to apply some Machine Learning Classifications like Multinomial Logistic Regression and K Nearest Neighbor (KNN) for each of them i will evaluate the model with two or three tests.


## Technologies Used
   **Python**
    Libraries:
    pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-lea
